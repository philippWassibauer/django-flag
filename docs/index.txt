django-flag
===========

This app lets users of your site flag content as inappropriate or spam.

By default some choices for status are available, however if you'd like to
customize them you can provide a ``FLAG_STATUSES`` setting which is a list of
two tuples where the first item is the value (a one character string) and the
second is the readable value.  The default choice should have a key of ``"1"``.

Settings
======
FLAG_EMAIL_NOTIFY_CREATOR: Set to True if you want to send a mail to the creator once his content got flagged (Default: False).
FLAG_EMAIL_NOTIFY_MANAGERS: Set to True if you want to send a mail to all managers once content got flagged (Default: False).

Email notification only works when DEBUG is set to False.
