django-flag
===========

This app lets users of your site flag content as inappropriate or spam.

(more here soon)



Settings
======
FLAG_EMAIL_NOTIFY_CREATOR: Set to True if you want to send a mail to the creator once his content got flagged (Default: False).
FLAG_EMAIL_NOTIFY_MANAGERS: Set to True if you want to send a mail to all managers once content got flagged (Default: False).

Email notification only works when DEBUG is set to False.
